## This repository serves as storage for a project I completed while attending the Coding Dojo bootcamp
### My project which is named Keystone MMA is a website that I built using Python, Flask, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript after completing the first programming stack I ever learned
### The goal was to not only create a website with basic information about the business, but to also create a user experience area that members of the gym can use to chronical and review different techniques learned during BJJ classes. 
### At completion the project was originally launced on Heroku, however, due to changing policies, it has since been removed
### Below you will find descriptions of the website and the work that I did to complete it
